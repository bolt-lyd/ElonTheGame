# ElonTheGame


Project from C++ class in spring 2020 semester. 

This was a colabrative project with a peer.

The premise of the game is to try to save a Tesla from being stolen, however, Elon believes you are the one
trying to steal it.

The game is very basic and a little crude looking but it really helped me to learn more about object oriented
progaming and then put that knowlage into practice.
